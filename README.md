### Day 4: Spring Multi-Layer Architecture with H2 Database
- Creating Entity classes with JPA annotations  
- Designing multi-layer architecture: Controller, Service, Repository  
- Introduction to H2 in-memory database and integration setup  
- Performing CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA  

### Day 5: Spring Boot Employee Payroll App with Service Layer
